# So, why does this exist?
I know that there are a gajillion different coreutils ports for Windows, but I wanted to make my own just to practice C++ in a Windows environment.

# Also, what is brmdir?
It's **B**etter rmdir. By rmdir, I mean the Windows rmdir though, and not the coreutils one. All it does is just add the `--ignore-fail-on-non-empty` parameter to it.
